To create React app:
> npx create-reaact-app {name of app}
(e.g. npx create-reaact-app my-app)


<a> tag 
    defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
    <a 
        href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com!
    </a>


<!-- List tag -->
<li> tag
    HTML element is used to represent an item in a list.

    The box-shadow property in CSS has up to six values, but the four most common are:


Properties:    
    > box-shadow: ( offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius color )
    For the parameters 0 0 0 0, here’s what each value means:

        - Offset-X (0): The horizontal shadow position. 
        A positive value moves the shadow to the right, a negative value to the left. 0 means no horizontal offset.
        
        - Offset-Y (0): The vertical shadow position. 
        A positive value moves the shadow down, a negative value up. 0 means no vertical offset.
    
        - Blur Radius (0): The blur amount for the shadow. 
        A higher value creates a softer, more blurred shadow. 0 means no blur, so the shadow has a hard edge.
    
        - Spread Radius (0): The size of the shadow. 
        A positive value expands the shadow, and a negative value contracts it. 0 means no spread, so the shadow will be the same size as the element.

    > height: [units: viewport height(vh)]
        /* 1vh is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport */
        /* 100vh means 100% of the viewport height */
        /* Height default value is 0, so need to set height to ensure the color occupies the entire background*/
        height: 100vh;

Note:
    - React (and JavaScript in general) uses camelCase for inline style properties. This means:

CSS syntax: animation-delay
React inline style syntax: animationDelay

"<div/>" VS "<div> <div/>"

Self-Closing Tag (<div className="my-classname"/>):

    This syntax is typically used when the element has no children (no content inside it).
    It is shorthand and cleaner for empty elements.
    It works the same way as <div className="my-classname"></div> if the div has no children, but it’s shorter and often considered more readable in JSX.

Opening and Closing Tag (<div className="my-classname"></div>):

    - Used when the element might have children (content or other elements inside it).
    - If there are no children, it will still function as an empty div, but it takes up more space.

children:
<div className="my-classname"> 
  <p>Hello there!</p> /*Children*/
  <span>Welcome!</span> /*Children*/
</div>


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN:
.mainpage-title span {}:
    - This selector targets all <span> elements that are inside an element with the class mainpage-title.
    - does not require the <span> elements themselves to have any specific class;
    - just looks for <span> elements within .mainpage-title.
and
.mainpage-title .span {}:
    - This selector targets elements with the class <span> that are inside an element with the class mainpage-title.

NOTE: (when importing videos as background/etc)
- Files located in the public folder of a React app cannot be imported using the import syntax. 
- The public folder is meant for static assets that can be accessed directly via a relative URL, not imported as modules
